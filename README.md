EcoCode-C#
===========

_ecoCode_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

_ecoCode_ is based on evolving catalogs of [good practices](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/docs/rules), for various technologies.

This set of Roslyn analyzers implements these catalogs as rules for scanning your C# projects.

> ⚠️ This is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the contribution section.
